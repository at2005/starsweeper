infrastructure and experiments for finding planet nine

plan:

- 28/11/2024: sedna detection via shift-stack in the fourier basis, in python using numpy
- 29/11/2024: detection via fft flaky :( so use wavelet 
- 30/11/2024: get wavelet to detect slow-moving nonlinear sources in super low SNR simulated environment with uneven sampling
- 30/11/2024: TODO: try running on real data w/ sedna
- 1/12/2024:  TODO: probably fix bugs and tune filters 
- 2/12/2024: TODO: port to CUDA when working 
- some date in the near future: find planet
